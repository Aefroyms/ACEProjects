Iowa</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the \"National Youth Administration\"</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. \"I saw how food changed them\", he said. \"All of this left scars on me.\"</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>\r\n         <li><strong>2005</strong> - states \"we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.\" Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because \"we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.

<header>Introduction</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.\r\n            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment\r\n            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the\r\n            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over\r\n            them.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,\r\n            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as\r\n            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can\r\n            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with\r\n            additional objects; for example:\r\n          </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying\r\n              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).\r\n              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place\r\n              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse\r\n              clicks, form input, and page navigation.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying\r\n              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,\r\n              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a\r\n              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to\r\n              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a\r\n              server.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"What_you_should_already_know\">\r\n        <header>What you should already know</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>\r\n\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web\r\n              (WWW).\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Some programming experience.

The JavaScript language resembles Java but\r\n            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.\r\n            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions\r\n            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was\r\n            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by\r\n            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small\r\n            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string\r\n            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the\r\n            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model\r\n            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary\r\n            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without\r\n            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of\r\n            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not\r\n            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have\r\n            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or\r\n            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,\r\n            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Hello_world\">\r\n        <header>Hello world</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write\r\n          your first \"Hello world\" JavaScript code:\r\n          <code\r\n            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert(\"Hello \" + yourName); }\r\n            greetMe(\"World\");\r\n          </code>\r\n\r\n          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your\r\n          browser!\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Variables\">\r\n        <header>Variables</header>\r\n        <p>\r\n          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.\r\n          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or\r\n          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).\r\n          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters\r\n          \"A\" through \"Z\" (uppercase) and the characters \"a\" through \"z\"\r\n          (lowercase).\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in\r\n          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as\r\n          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are\r\n          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Declaring_variables\">\r\n        <header>Declaring variables</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          You can declare a variable in three ways:\r\n          <p>\r\n            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This\r\n            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            By simply assigning it a value. For example,\r\n            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It\r\n            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this\r\n            variant.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This\r\n            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See\r\n            Variable scope below.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Variable_scope\">\r\n        <header>Variable scope</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>\r\n            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a\r\n            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the\r\n            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it\r\n            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that\r\n            function.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement\r\n            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the\r\n            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For\r\n            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the\r\n            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the\r\n            block, which in this case is an if statement.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in\r\n            ECMAScript 2015.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <code\r\n            >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is\r\n            not defined</code\r\n          >\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Global_variables\">\r\n        <header>Global variables</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web\r\n            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global\r\n            variables using the window.variable syntax.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window\r\n            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or\r\n            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is\r\n            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an\r\n            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Constants\">\r\n        <header>Constants</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>\r\n            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.\r\n            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable\r\n            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign\r\n            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>\r\n          <p>\r\n            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared\r\n            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block\r\n            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is\r\n            assumed to represent a variable.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or\r\n            variable in the same scope.

Objects and\r\n          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can\r\n          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as\r\n          procedures that your application can perform.\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"if...else_statement\">\r\n        <header>if...else statement</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is\r\n          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the\r\n          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:\r\n\r\n          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>\r\n          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See\r\n          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If\r\n          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,\r\n          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any\r\n          statement, including further nested if statements.\r\n          <p>\r\n            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple\r\n            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:\r\n          </p>\r\n          <code\r\n            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {\r\n            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {\r\n            statement_last; }\r\n          </code>\r\n          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition\r\n          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple\r\n          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In\r\n          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially\r\n          when nesting if statements:\r\n\r\n          <code\r\n            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;\r\n            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {\r\n            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;\r\n            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code\r\n          >\r\n          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional\r\n          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when\r\n          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:\r\n          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use\r\n          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put\r\n          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:\r\n\r\n          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"while_statement\">\r\n        <header>while statement</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified\r\n          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:\r\n\r\n          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes\r\n          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to\r\n          the statement following the loop.\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.\r\n            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the\r\n            condition is tested again.

Iowa</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the \"National Youth Administration\"</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. \"I saw how food changed them\", he said. \"All of this left scars on me.\"</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>\r\n         <li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>\r\n         <li><strong>2005</strong> - states \"we will have to double the world food supply by 2050.\" Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because \"we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time.

Inside a host environment\r\n            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the\r\n            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over\r\n            them.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,\r\n            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as\r\n            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can\r\n            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with\r\n            additional objects; for example:\r\n          </p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying\r\n              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).\r\n              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place\r\n              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse\r\n              clicks, form input, and page navigation.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying\r\n              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,\r\n              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a\r\n              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to\r\n              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a\r\n              server.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"What_you_should_already_know\">\r\n        <header>What you should already know</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>\r\n\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web\r\n              (WWW).\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              Some programming experience.

The JavaScript language resembles Java but\r\n            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.\r\n            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions\r\n            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was\r\n            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by\r\n            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small\r\n            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string\r\n            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the\r\n            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model\r\n            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary\r\n            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without\r\n            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of\r\n            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not\r\n            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have\r\n            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or\r\n            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,\r\n            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Hello_world\">\r\n        <header>Hello world</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write\r\n          your first \"Hello world\" JavaScript code:\r\n          <code\r\n            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert(\"Hello \" + yourName); }\r\n            greetMe(\"World\");\r\n          </code>\r\n\r\n          Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your\r\n          browser!\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Variables\">\r\n        <header>Variables</header>\r\n        <p>\r\n          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.\r\n          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or\r\n          dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).\r\n          Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters\r\n          \"A\" through \"Z\" (uppercase) and the characters \"a\" through \"z\"\r\n          (lowercase).\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in\r\n          identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as\r\n          characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are\r\n          Number_hits, temp99, and _name.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Declaring_variables\">\r\n        <header>Declaring variables</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          You can declare a variable in three ways:\r\n          <p>\r\n            With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This\r\n            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            By simply assigning it a value. For example,\r\n            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It\r\n            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this\r\n            variant.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This\r\n            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See\r\n            Variable scope below.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Variable_scope\">\r\n        <header>Variable scope</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>\r\n            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a\r\n            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the\r\n            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it\r\n            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that\r\n            function.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement\r\n            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the\r\n            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For\r\n            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the\r\n            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the\r\n            block, which in this case is an if statement.\r\n          </p>\r\n          <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>\r\n          <p>\r\n            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in\r\n            ECMAScript 2015.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <code\r\n            >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is\r\n            not defined</code\r\n          >\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Global_variables\">\r\n        <header>Global variables</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>\r\n            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web\r\n            pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global\r\n            variables using the window.variable syntax.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window\r\n            or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or\r\n            frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is\r\n            declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an\r\n            iframe as parent.phoneNumber.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Constants\">\r\n        <header>Constants</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>\r\n            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.\r\n            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable\r\n            identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign\r\n            and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>\r\n          <p>\r\n            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared\r\n            while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block\r\n            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is\r\n            assumed to represent a variable.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or\r\n            variable in the same scope. For example:\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <code\r\n            >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS\r\n            WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;\r\n            //statements }</code\r\n          >\r\n          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following\r\n          statement is executed without problems.\r\n          <code\r\n            >const MY_OBJECT = {\"key\": \"value\"}; MY_OBJECT.key =\r\n            \"otherValue\";</code\r\n          >\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Data_types\">\r\n        <header>Data types</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>\r\n              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>\r\n              <ul>\r\n                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because\r\n                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,\r\n                  NULL, or any other variant.\r\n                </li>\r\n                <li>\r\n                  undefined.

Objects and\r\n          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can\r\n          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as\r\n          procedures that your application can perform.\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"if...else_statement\">\r\n        <header>if...else statement</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is\r\n          true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the\r\n          condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:\r\n\r\n          <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>\r\n          condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See\r\n          Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If\r\n          condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,\r\n          statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any\r\n          statement, including further nested if statements.\r\n          <p>\r\n            You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple\r\n            conditions tested in sequence, as follows:\r\n          </p>\r\n          <code\r\n            >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {\r\n            statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {\r\n            statement_last; }\r\n          </code>\r\n          In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition\r\n          which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple\r\n          statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In\r\n          general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially\r\n          when nesting if statements:\r\n\r\n          <code\r\n            >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;\r\n            statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {\r\n            statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;\r\n            statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code\r\n          >\r\n          It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional\r\n          expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when\r\n          glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:\r\n          <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use\r\n          an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put\r\n          additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:\r\n\r\n          <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"while_statement\">\r\n        <header>while statement</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified\r\n          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:\r\n\r\n          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes\r\n          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to\r\n          the statement following the loop.\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.\r\n            If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the\r\n            condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution\r\n            stops and control is passed to the statement following while.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to\r\n            group those statements.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          Example:\r\n\r\n          <p>\r\n            The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>\r\n          <p>\r\n            With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.\r\n            Therefore, x and n take on the following values:\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>\r\n            <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>\r\n            <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>\r\n            After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer\r\n            true, so the loop terminates.\r\n          </p>\r\n        </article>\r\n      </section>\r\n      <section class=\"main-section\" id=\"Function_declarations\">\r\n        <header>Function declarations</header>\r\n        <article>\r\n          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function\r\n          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:\r\n\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>The name of the function.</li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and\r\n              separated by commas.\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li>\r\n              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in\r\n              curly brackets, { }.\r\n            </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <p>\r\n            For example, the following code defines a simple function named\r\n            square:\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>\r\n          <p>\r\n            The function square takes one argument, called number.
